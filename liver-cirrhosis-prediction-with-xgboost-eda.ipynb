The first 312 cases in the dataset participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival. Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized participants."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i6wp8lTJjL5C"},"source":["The dataset consists of following columns :\n","1.
